## Project: Image Classifier using Tensor Flow

### Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the customer_segments.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included visuals.py Python file and the housing.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in visuals.py is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory customer_segments/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook image_classification.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook image_classification.ipynb

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The data is available at [CIFAR 10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) website 

### Blog

Higher level perspective of the project is present in my [blog](https://pradeepsaiblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/another-blog-post/).
