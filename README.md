# Machine Learning Examples
This Repository consists of different kinds of Machine Learnnig models, which are coded in Python.
## Introduction to topics
1. **Supervised Learning**:- In this kind of model, target label is used while training the model. E.g:- Predicting the housing prices of new houses, provided some sample about existing price of houses and some features which impact the housing price
    * **Regression Techniques**
    * **Neural Networks**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**:- Here we have a un labeled data, meaning we want to classify data into various groups but we are not sure based on training data which class each data set belongs to.
    * **Clustering**:- Unsupervised learning can be done by seperating data into set of clusters or groups based on similarity score between different points. Similar data points can be clustered into similar groups.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**:- In this kind of learning the model needn't be aware of how the system works, but if model is given +ve or -ve rewards based on it's performance it can learn on it's own.
